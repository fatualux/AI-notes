# Neuron Weights

The **weights** on the input are similar to the coefficients used in a [***regression equation***](./regression.md).

Each neuron has also a ***bias***, an input that always must be weighted.

For example, a neuron may have two inputs, which require three weightsâ€”one for each input and one for the bias.

Weights are:
- Often initialized to small random values.
- Larger weights indicate increased complexity and fragility.
