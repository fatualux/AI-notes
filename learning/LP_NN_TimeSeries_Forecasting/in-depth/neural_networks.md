# Neural networks

It is a field that investigates how simple __models of biological brains__ can be used to __solve difficult computational tasks__ (e.g. predictive modeling tasks).

The goal is not to create realistic models of the brain but instead to develop robust algorithms and data structures that we can use to model difficult problems.

Neural networks learn mapping (any mapping function), to learn best to relate the training datasets to the output variable you want to predict.

The predictive capability of neural networks comes from the **hierarchical** or **multi-layered structure** of the networks.
