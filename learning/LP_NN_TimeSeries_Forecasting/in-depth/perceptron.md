# Perceptrons

A ***perceptron*** (or McCullochâ€“Pitts neuron), is a single neuron model that was a precursor to larger neural networks.

Perceptron is a __single layer neural network__ and a multi-layer perceptron is called Neural Networks.

The perceptron consists of 4 parts.
1. Input values or One input layer
2. Weights and Bias
3. Net sum
4. Activation Function
