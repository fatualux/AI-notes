# Neural Networks (NNs) Time-series forecasting

### Scopes:

- how to choose a NN for time-series forecasting;
- how many past samples are needed to discover a pattern;
- which is the impact of noise on the prediction quality.

### Suitable kinds of [Neural Networks](./in-depth/neural_networks.md)

- [**Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**](./in-depth/multi-layer_perceptron.md): the most common and simple.

- [**Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**]: in literature, the most suited to time-series forecasting.  
They combine the information of the current observation, with the information of the previous observations.

- [**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**]: usually applied for Computer Vision, they are raising also for time-series forecasting.
