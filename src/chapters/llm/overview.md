# What is an LLM?

A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. These models are built using deep learning techniques, particularly neural networks with many layers, and are trained on vast amounts of text data. Key features and components include:

### Architecture:
Typically based on Transformer architectures, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), and others.

### Training Data:
Trained on diverse and extensive datasets that include books, articles, websites, and other text sources to capture a wide range of language patterns and knowledge.

### Capabilities:
**Natural Language Understanding**: Comprehending and interpreting text.
**Natural Language Generation**: Producing coherent and contextually relevant text.
**Language Translation**: Converting text from one language to another.
**Question Answering**: Responding to queries based on learned knowledge.
**Text Summarization**: Condensing long texts into shorter summaries.
