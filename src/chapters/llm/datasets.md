# Datasets

A dataset is a structured collection of data organized for easy access, management, and analysis. In various domains such as machine learning, data science, and statistics, datasets serve as the primary source of information for training models, conducting experiments, and drawing insights. Here’s an in-depth look at datasets:

### Components

**Data Points (Records)**: Individual entries or observations within the dataset. For example, each row in a table might represent a single instance or sample.

**Features (Attributes, Columns)**: Variables or characteristics of each data point. In a tabular dataset, features are represented as columns. For instance, in a customer dataset, features might include age, income, and purchase history.

**Labels (Targets)**: In supervised learning, labels are the outcomes or responses associated with the data points. For instance, in a classification problem, labels might be categories like “spam” or “not spam.”

### Types

**Structured Data**: Organized into rows and columns, often stored in databases or spreadsheets. Examples include CSV files, SQL databases, and Excel sheets.

**Unstructured Data**: Lacks a predefined format, such as text, images, or audio files. This type includes documents, social media posts, and multimedia content.

**Semi-Structured Data**: Contains elements of both structured and unstructured data, like JSON or XML files, where data is organized in a hierarchical format but may contain variable content.
