# What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content, such as text, image, video and audio.

It was introduced in 1950s by John von Neumann and other scientists, and used mainly for chatbots (an example of a primordial chatbot is Eliza, developed in 1966 by Joseph Weizenbaum).

In 2014, with the introduction of GANs ([Generative Adversarial Networks](./machine-learning/gans.md)), Generative AI becomes more popular, due to its ability to generate images, videos and text.
