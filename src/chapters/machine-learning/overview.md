# Machine Learning

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science, focusing on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from data.

### Types of Machine Learning:

**Supervised Learning**: The model is trained on labeled data, where the input-output pairs are known. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Common tasks include classification and regression.

**Unsupervised Learning**: The model is trained on unlabeled data, aiming to discover underlying patterns or structures. Common tasks include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

**Semi-Supervised Learning**: Combines both labeled and unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy, especially useful when labeled data is scarce.

**Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions, and aiming to maximize cumulative rewards.

### Key Components:

[**Datasets**](../models/datasets.md): The data used for training and evaluating the model, often split into training, validation, and test sets.

[**Features**](./features.md): The input variables or attributes used by the model to make predictions.

[**Model**](../models/overview.md): The mathematical representation that learns from data and makes predictions.

[**Training**](../models/training.md): The process of optimizing the model's parameters using data.

[**Validation**](../models/evaluation.md): Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Algorithms and Techniques:

[**Regression**](../regression.md): A statistical model that predicts a numerical value based on a set of features.

[**Decision Trees**](../models/decision-trees.md): A tree-based model that classifies data based on the values of features.

[**Support Vector Machines (SVM)**](../models/svm.md): A classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane separating different classes.

[**Neural Networks**](../machine-learning/neural-networks.md): Computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons).

**Ensemble Methods**: Techniques that combine multiple models to improve performance, such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting.

### Applications:
- Image and speech recognition
