# Machine Learning

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science, focusing on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from data.

### Types of Machine Learning:

**Supervised Learning**: The model is trained on labeled data, where the input-output pairs are known. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Common tasks include classification and regression.

**Unsupervised Learning**: The model is trained on unlabeled data, aiming to discover underlying patterns or structures. Common tasks include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

**Semi-Supervised Learning**: Combines both labeled and unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy, especially useful when labeled data is scarce.

**Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions, and aiming to maximize cumulative rewards.

### Key Components:

**Datasets**: The data used for training and evaluating the model, often split into training, validation, and test sets.

**Features**: The input variables or attributes used by the model to make predictions.

**Model**: The mathematical representation that learns from data and makes predictions.

**Training**: The process of optimizing the model's parameters using data.

**Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Algorithms and Techniques:

**Linear Regression**: Predicting continuous outcomes based on linear relationships between input features.

**Logistic Regression**: A classification algorithm used to predict binary outcomes.

**Decision Trees**: A model that splits data into branches to make predictions based on feature values.

**Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane separating different classes.

**Neural Networks**: Computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons).

**k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies based on the majority class among the k nearest data points.

**Ensemble Methods**: Techniques that combine multiple models to improve performance, such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting.
