# Ridge Regression

Ridge regression, also known as Tikhonov regularization, is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term to prevent overfitting and handle multicollinearity. It modifies the standard linear regression model by adding a penalty term to the loss function.

## Ridge Regression Formula

The formula for ridge regression is:

\\[ \hat{Y} = X \beta + \epsilon \\]

where \\( \beta \\) is estimated by minimizing the following objective function:

\\[ \text{Cost Function} = \|Y - X\beta\|^2 + \lambda \|\beta\|^2 \\]

where:

- **\( Y \)**: Response variable.
- **\( X \)**: Predictor variables.
- **\( \beta \)**: Coefficients to be estimated.
- **\( \lambda \)**: Regularization parameter (also known as ridge penalty).

### Table of Terms

| Formula       | Meaning                | Interpretation                                                       |
|---------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| \(\|Y - X\beta\|^2\) | **Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)** | Measures the difference between observed and predicted values |
| \(\lambda \|\beta\|^2\) | **Regularization Term** | Penalizes large coefficients to prevent overfitting                    |
| \(\lambda\)   | ***Regularization Parameter*** | Controls the strength of the penalty; higher values increase regularization |

## Components

- **Dependent Variable (Target)**: The variable being predicted.
- **Independent Variables (Features)**: The predictors used in the model.
- **Regularization Term**: Added to the loss function to penalize large coefficients, helping to reduce model complexity.

## Training

- **Estimation of Coefficients**: Ridge regression coefficients are estimated by minimizing the regularized cost function. The solution can be computed using the following formula:

  \\[ \hat{\beta} = (X^TX + \lambda I)^{-1}X^TY \\]

  where \( I \) is the identity matrix.

- **Cost Function**: The cost function includes both the residual sum of squares and the regularization term:

  \\[ \text{Cost Function} = \|Y - X\beta\|^2 + \lambda \|\beta\|^2 \\]

- **Optimization**: Ridge regression finds the optimal coefficients by solving the regularized optimization problem.

## Importance

- **Handling Multicollinearity**: Ridge regression can handle multicollinearity by penalizing large coefficients, leading to more stable estimates.
- **Regularization**: Prevents overfitting by adding a penalty for large coefficients, improving model generalization.
- **Bias-Variance Trade-off**: Balances bias and variance, leading to a more robust model, especially when the number of predictors is high relative to the number of observations.

## Challenges

- **Choice of \(\lambda\)**: Selecting the appropriate value for the regularization parameter \(\lambda\) is crucial. Cross-validation is often used to determine the optimal value.
- **Interpretability**: The introduction of regularization can make the model harder to interpret compared to ordinary least squares regression.

## Applications

- **Economics**: Used to model economic indicators when multicollinearity is present.
- **Finance**: Applied in financial modeling to handle datasets with correlated features.
- **Healthcare**: Helps in medical research where predictor variables may be highly correlated.

## Summary

Ridge Regression is a variation of linear regression that incorporates regularization to address multicollinearity and overfitting. By adding a penalty term to the cost function, ridge regression stabilizes coefficient estimates and improves model performance. It is especially useful in situations with many predictors or when predictors are highly correlated.
